# X-Team 27 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
-Whoever has the most confidence in the task can do problem if extra help is needed to complete the task then more will be assigned based on time availability.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
-Send status updates on group chat include problems and bugs.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
-Group chat problems and respond with solutions if you can solve the problem.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
-Communicate on groupchat about deadlines and tasks.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
-Comment your work properly, before saving. Comment what you did to change in the change log.
-If there are issues with communication over group chat setup in-person meetings to help better understand a problem.
